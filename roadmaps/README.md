## Learning Philosophy

### The 70-20-10 Rule
```
How to Learn Effectively
├── 70% - Building projects
├── 20% - Learning from others (code review, pair programming)
└── 10% - Courses & tutorials
```

### Avoid These Traps
- **Tutorial hell** - Watching without building
- **Tool chasing** - New framework every week
- **Perfectionism** - Shipping nothing
- **Breadth without depth** - Jack of all trades, master of none
- **Isolated learning** - Not joining communities

### Best Practices
1. **Build in public** - Share your journey on Twitter/LinkedIn
2. **Contribute to open source** - Real-world experience
3. **Join communities** - Discord, Reddit, local meetups
4. **Teach what you learn** - Blog posts, YouTube videos
5. **Build a portfolio** - Projects > credentials

## How AI Changes Everything

### What AI Does Well
- Writing boilerplate code
- Explaining concepts
- Debugging common issues
- Code review suggestions
- Documentation generation
- Refactoring assistance

### What AI Struggles With
- System architecture decisions
- Understanding business context
- Debugging complex distributed systems
- Security & threat modeling
- Novel problem-solving
- Stakeholder communication

### Your AI Survival Strategy
```
How to Stay Relevant
├── Learn to work WITH AI
│   ├── Prompt engineering
│   ├── AI-assisted development
│   └── Reviewing AI output critically
├── Go deeper, not wider
│   └── Deep expertise + AI = 10x productivity
├── Focus on "glue" skills
│   ├── System design
│   ├── Debugging across boundaries
│   └── Understanding trade-offs
└── Build judgment & context
    └── AI lacks the "why" - you provide it
```

## Certification Guide

### Worth Getting
| Certification | Value | Cost |
|--------------|-------|------|
| AWS Solutions Architect Associate | High | $150 |
| CKA (Kubernetes Admin) | Very High | $395 |
| Google Cloud Professional | High | $200 |
| HashiCorp Terraform | Medium | $70 |

### Skip These (Usually)
- Most vendor-specific bootcamp certificates
- Generic "Full Stack Developer" certificates
- Paid certificates from tutorial sites
- Any certificate without hands-on exam

### Better Than Certificates
1. **GitHub profile** with real projects
2. **Technical blog** with your learnings
3. **Open source contributions**
4. **Deployed applications** people use

## Time Investment Reality Check

```
Time to Job-Ready (Realistic Estimates)

Career Changer (0 experience):
├── Dedicated full-time: 6-12 months
└── Part-time (10-20 hrs/week): 12-24 months

Adjacent Field (some programming):
├── Dedicated full-time: 3-6 months
└── Part-time: 6-12 months

Already Developer (new specialty):
├── Dedicated full-time: 2-4 months
└── Part-time: 4-8 months

Note: These are minimums to be "job-ready"
      Mastery takes 3-5+ years in any field
```
