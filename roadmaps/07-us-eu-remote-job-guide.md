## Salary Negotiation

### How to Talk About Salary

**When Asked "What's Your Expected Salary?"**

```
Scripts for Different Situations
──────────────────────────────────────────────

Early in Process:
"I'm targeting $80,000-$100,000 depending on the total
compensation package and scope of the role. I'm flexible
for the right opportunity. What's the budget for this position?"

After Getting Offer Below Target:
"Thank you for the offer. Based on my experience with US
startups, my performance optimization expertise, and the
market rate for this role, I was expecting something closer
to $85,000. Is there flexibility in the budget?"

If They Push for Lower Due to Location:
"I understand location is a factor, but I want to highlight
that I've been successfully working with US teams for 2+ years,
I'm available during US hours, and my work quality is equivalent
to US-based engineers. I'm looking for compensation that reflects
the value I bring rather than just geography."
```

### Negotiation Tips

1. **Never give a number first** if possible
2. **Research the company** (Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, Blind)
3. **Consider total comp** (base + equity + benefits)
4. **Get it in writing** before accepting
5. **Don't accept immediately** - "Can I have 24-48 hours to review?"

### Equity Basics

```
Startup Equity 101
├── Stock options vs RSUs
├── Vesting schedule (usually 4 years, 1 year cliff)
├── Strike price matters
├── Understand dilution
├── Ask about 409A valuation
└── Equity is often worth $0 (factor that in)
```

| **Benefits** | Health, PTO, equity | None (you handle) |
| **Stability** | Higher | Lower |
| **Taxes** | Company handles | You handle |
| **Flexibility** | Less | More |

### Contract Rates to Target

| Experience | Hourly Rate | Annual (Full-Time Equiv) |
|------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| 3 years | $40-60/hr | $80K-$120K |
| 5 years | $60-80/hr | $120K-$160K |
